	<p> 	In my free time, my main hobby is playing guitar. However, for me this includes a
		love of making things with my own hands, including electronics (creating/ modifying pedals, sticking a
		soldering iron inside and altering my guitars and amplifiers) and woodwork (I have constructed my own
		pedalboard from scrap bits), allowing my creativity to extend beyond just playing an instrument. </p>
	<p>	I also love going to shows, especially at small local venues, where I feel like I am supporting the bands and
		the music scene where I am. 
	</p>

	<p>	Along with this I have a keen interest in trying to keep up with the latest releases in music, games
		and film (or at least rushing to around Oscars time every year), as well as enjoying reading. 
		In University I was part of the student radio, where I presented a show playing songs in a theme once a week. 
		Responsibilities for the show included planning and preparing new material every week, and being punctual for the
		slot, so that there were no gaps between shows. Along with this both me and my co-host found fun in creating small 
		skits as semi-regular parts of the show - from writing and recording our own fake advertisements to weekly segments, 
		we tried to make the show feel more like an actual radio rather than two guys sitting in a room in the SU.</p>
