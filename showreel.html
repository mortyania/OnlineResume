			<p>This is a picture of a Mint green Jazzmaster, a beautiful guitar. God I want it. </br>
				I need it. I have a Jaguar copy sort of thing but I'm jonesing for an actual Jazzmaster.<br/>
				That's a bad idea for my bank account but I want one so bad

				This is the video I made to show my dissertation project in use. It ties together with the Project Poster I made to 
				fully describe the project. I am proud of this as it was my first attempt at video editing, and although it's pretty 
				minimal I feel like I got the job done to the quality it needed to be. <br/>
				This was shown together with the poster at a convention style event where all the final year students on my course 
				took a room and displayed all our projects, which was a great experience to see everyone's hard work.

				This was my final year Vision and Sound project. We were given this movie without any audio and we had to completely 
				create the sound effects, ambiences and compose the score. I really enjoy some of the compositions I did for this, 
				I feel as though it was some of my best, probably because I was working with reigns rather than having free control 
				over all aspects of the music.
