	<b>Software Development Technician (.NET)</b><br/>
	<i>QA Apprenticeships</i>
	<p class='result'>Level 3</p>
	<div class='education-text'>
	<p>After completing my degree I found myself wanting to get a job within Software Development but not having the explicit qualifications to get 
		into the industry. While My degree gave me the building blocks and a great start into the world of object orientated programming, I was left
		without some of the more basic skills of candidates that have done Computer Science.</p>
	<p>Rather than go back to full time education, I decided to enrol in an apprenticeship in Computing so that I would gain on-the-job experience as 
		well as a more rounded and practical understanding of development.</p>
	<ul class='education-list'>
		<li>Course was focused on the .NET framework and gave me skills in writing elegant C#, which extended into using ASP.NET and Windows Forms</li>
		<li>Using MSSQL to query databases, data analysis and normalisation, and using SSMS</li>	
		<li>Web Development using HTML, CSS and Javascript</li>
		<li>In depth understanding of the software development lifecycle</li>
	</ul>
